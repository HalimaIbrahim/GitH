# Create a rock paper scissors game, Player vs Computer

"""
* create random number generator for computer within range(1, 3) to 
represent a hand
* attach numerical values to hands: 1 = rock; 2 = paper; 3 = scissors
through conditional check
* Asking the user to pick a hand, create numerical input
* Play the game: conditional structure comparing user hand against 
computer hand
* Return who has won
